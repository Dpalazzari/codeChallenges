# javascriptChallenges


A series of javascript challenges practicing both raw JavaScript ability and unit tests using mocha/chai.

## Notes
- While in debugger mode, hit 'c' to run to first instance of debugger, then type 'repl' to enter a repl session where all variables are available.

- Will also be doing the challenges in Ruby to cement my Ruby knowledge.
