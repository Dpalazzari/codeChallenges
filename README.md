# Javascript, Ruby and Python Challenges

- A series of Ruby challenges practicing both raw Ruby and unit tests using minitest.
- A series of JavaScript challenges practicing both raw JavaScript ability and unit tests using mocha/chai.
- A series of Python challenges learning OOP programming in python and unit testing.

## Notes
- While in debugger mode, hit 'c' to run to first instance of debugger, then type 'repl' to enter a repl session where all variables are available.

- Will also be doing the challenges in Ruby to cement my Ruby knowledge.

- Have begun to solve existing challenges in Python.

## Set-up

- To run JavaScript unit tests from the root directory:

```
npm install
```
```
npm run test
```
- To run tests with a debugger:
```
npm run debug
```

- To run all Ruby tests:
```
cd Ruby/
```
```
bundle
```
```
rake
```

## Future

- Add all challenges in Python, with unit testing.
